# Trading Strategy: Trend Following with RSI Confirmation

## Entry Rules
1. Identify strong trend using 20, 50, and 200 EMA alignment
2. Wait for RSI to enter oversold (< 30) for buy or overbought (> 70) for sell
3. Confirm with MACD crossover in the same direction
4. Volume must be above average (1.5x or more)
5. Check multiple timeframes (H1, H4, D1) for confluence

## Risk Management
- Risk only 1% of account per trade
- Minimum Risk/Reward ratio: 2:1
- Maximum 3 open positions at once
- Stop loss below/above recent support/resistance

## Exit Rules
- Take profit at predetermined level (2x stop loss minimum)
- Trail stop loss when in profit by 1x risk
- Exit if opposite signal appears on higher timeframe

## Key Principles
- Patience is critical - wait for all conditions to align
- Never trade against the major trend
- Protect capital first, profits second
- Quality over quantity - few perfect trades beat many mediocre ones
